the code above is expoected to have ashape (28 , 28,1) but mine gives a (28,28)
as follows are my values vs expected


Maximum pixel value after normalization: 1.0

Shape of training set after reshaping: (60000, 28, 28)

Shape of one image after reshaping: (28, 28)
Expected Output:

Maximum pixel value after normalization: 1.0

Shape of training set after reshaping: (60000, 28, 28, 1)

Shape of one image after reshaping: (28, 28, 1)
